A normal pentagon star can be inscribed by a circle, creating 5 sectors of equal length, with radian measure of 2pi/5 for each

To find the coordinates of the points where the star and circle touch, we can use two methods:

we can represent it as a polar function through: 

r = sec((2/n) * arcsin(sin((n/2)theta))

in this method, we will return all non-differentiable points 

This can be found easily through how a polar function is represented and made, with coordinates being based on a unit circle of 
(theta, r)

By examining the angle of elevation makde with the x-axis, we get the following coordinates starting from the top and travelling clockwise:

(12pi/5, 1), (0, 1), (8pi/5, 1), (16pi/5, 1), (4pi/5, 1)

We observe that the radius is 1 for all of them, showing that there lies an equidistant point in the center

As with all triangle-like shapes, we can extrapulate the coordinates through trig.

Setting up relations:
